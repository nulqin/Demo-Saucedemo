Demo project with full scripting using Katalon Studios and TDD. I also hit the e-commerce demo website https://lnkd.in/gDwsfY72. 
The test scenario is 
1. Valid and Invalid login user 
2. Add and Remove items from the cart
3. Valid and Invalid checkout items from the cart 
Also, create some validation to verify the item in the cart, verify the price is equal, and verify login. I already integrated this Demo project using local CI/CD Jenkins.

Next improvement : 
1. Create the framework using Cucumber. 
2. Integrated with JUnit.
3. Integrated report with Email.
